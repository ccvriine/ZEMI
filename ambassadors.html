                <br>Isabella Khair Hadid was born on October
                9, 1996, in Washington, D.C. Hadid's father, 
                Mohamed Hadid, is an architect and real 
                estate developer. Her mother, Yolanda 
                Hadid, is a former model who starred on 
                The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Hadid 
                grew up with an older sister, Gigi, and a 
                younger brother, Anwar, both of whom are 
                also models. In addition, Hadid has two 
                older half-sisters, Alana and Marielle, from 
                a past relationship of her father's.<br>

                
                
                <br>After high school, Hadid left California to
                study photography at the Parsons School of
                Design in New York City. At the time, her 
                sister Gigi was already a successful model. 
                Hadid was modeling herself and soon came 
                to believe she was "learning more with 
                photographers on set than I was in school." 
                She opted to leave school to focus on this 
                career. In 2015, she made her runway debut 
                for Tom Ford at New York City's Fashion Week.<br>

                
                
                <br>In 2021, Hadid returned to a revamped Victoria's
                Secret as part of its VS Collective. She said 
                she made the decision because she felt the 
                company was "moving forward with not only body 
                diversity, but diversity of women in general."<br>

                photo quickly went viral, garnering over 
                20,000 likes in 24 hours. Yai caught the
